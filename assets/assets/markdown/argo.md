# ARGO

## Brief

Argo is a full-stack cross-platform mobile application built in Flutter, designed to solve a real problem in the
collegiate rowing recruitment space. Coaches often struggle to discover and track prospective athletes, while athletes
lack a dedicated platform to showcase their progress. Argo bridges that gap.

## Overview

The recruiting process in rowing is surprisingly manual — coaches rely on emails, spreadsheets, and word-of-mouth to
find talent. Argo aims to change that by providing a rowing-specific platform where athletes can build a profile and
post workout scores, and coaches can follow athletes and receive real-time updates when new results come in.

The app is built in Flutter, targeting both iOS and Android from a single codebase. It uses Firebase for backend
services, including Firestore for data storage and Firebase Authentication for user accounts. The project is currently
in active development and has been a great way to get hands-on experience with Flutter and its ecosystem.

### Features

- Athlete profiles for showcasing personal bests and workout history
- Real-time updates for coaches when followed athletes post new scores or competition results
- Firebase Authentication for secure account management
- Cross-platform support for iOS and Android
